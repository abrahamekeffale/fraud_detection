# fraud_detection
Overview
This repository contains a Flask API that leverages a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The model is designed to analyze input data and predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages: Flask, scikit-learn, and other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-api.git Â  

Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies:
Bash
cd fraud_detection_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Running the API
Start the Flask App:

Bash
python serve_model.py
Use code with caution.

Test the API:

Use tools like Postman or curl to send POST requests to the /predict endpoint with JSON data containing transaction features.
The API will return a JSON response indicating whether the transaction is predicted to be fraudulent or legitimate.
API Endpoints
/predict:
Method: POST
Input: JSON data containing transaction features (e.g., amount, merchant category, location, etc.)
Output: JSON response with the predicted label (fraudulent or legitimate).
Model Explainability
The API may optionally include endpoints for model explainability using techniques like SHAP or LIME. These endpoints can provide insights into the model's decision-making process.

Dockerization
For deployment, a Dockerfile is provided to create a Docker image. You can build and run the image using the following commands:

Bash
docker build -t fraud_detection_api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud_detection_api
Use code with caution.

This will start a Docker container and expose the Flask app on port 5000.

Additional Considerations
Model Training: Ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Security: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data, such as using HTTPS and secure authentication mechanisms.
Deployment: Consider using a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform for deployment and scaling.
Monitoring: Monitor the API's performance and health, and retrain the model as needed to maintain accuracy.
By following these guidelines, you can effectively deploy and manage your fraud detection API.
